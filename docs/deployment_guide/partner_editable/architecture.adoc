This solution provides separate AWS CloudFormation templates to support three deployment scenarios. For each scenario, you also have the option to create a new virtual private cloud (VPC) or use your existing VPC infrastructure. Choose the scenario that best fits your needs.

* *Scenario 1: Deploy and manage your own AD DS installation on the Amazon EC2 instances.* The AWS CloudFormation template for this scenario builds the AWS Cloud infrastructure, and sets up and configures AD DS and AD-integrated DNS on the AWS Cloud. It doesn't include AWS Directory Service, so you handle all AD DS maintenance and monitoring tasks yourself. You can also choose to deploy the solution into your existing VPC infrastructure.
* *Scenario 2: Extend your on-premises AD DS to AWS on Amazon EC2 instances.* The AWS CloudFormation template for this scenario builds the base AWS Cloud infrastructure for AD DS, and you perform several manual steps to extend your existing network to AWS and to promote your domain controllers. As in scenario 1, you manage all AD DS tasks yourself. You can also choose to deploy the solution into your existing VPC infrastructure.
* *Scenario 3: Deploy AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory (AWS Managed Microsoft AD).* The AWS CloudFormation template for this scenario builds the base AWS Cloud infrastructure and then deploys AWS Managed Microsoft AD on the AWS Cloud. AWS Directory Service takes care of AD DS tasks such as building a highly available directory topology, monitoring domain controllers, and configuring backups and snapshots. As with the first two scenarios, you can choose to deploy the solution into an existing VPC infrastructure.

For all new AD DS installations, the solution also deploys AD DS and AD-integrated DNS, and it sets up Active Directory sites and subnets.

The following sections discuss the architecture for each scenario. 

=== Scenario 1: Deploy self-managed AD

Scenario 1 is based on a new installation of AD DS in the AWS Cloud without AWS Directory Service.

As illustrated in <<architecture1>>, the AWS CloudFormation templates that automate this deployment set up the following (with an option to deploy a certificate authority in Availability Zone 1):

* A VPC configured with public and private subnets in two Availability Zones for high availability.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** Remote Desktop Gateway (RD Gateway) instances in an Auto Scaling group to help secure remote access to instances in private subnets.*
* In the private subnets, a Windows Server forest and domain functional level, including security groups and rules for traffic between instances.
* AWS Systems Manager Automation documents to set up and configure AD DS and AD-integrated DNS.
* AWS Secrets Manager to store passwords.

[.small]#* The template that deploys the solution into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#

In this architecture, domain controllers are deployed into two private VPC subnets in separate Availability Zones, making AD DS highly available. NAT gateways are deployed to public subnets, providing outbound internet access for instances in private subnets. Remote Desktop Gateways are deployed in an Auto Scaling group to the public subnets to help secure remote access to instances in private subnets. You can deploy an optional certificate authority in Availability Zone 1.

Windows Server 2019 is used for the Remote Desktop Gateway instances and the domain controller instances. The AWS CloudFormation template deploys AWS resources, including a Systems Manager Automation document. When the second node is deployed, it triggers execution of the Automation document through Amazon EC2 user data. The automation workflow deploys the required components, finalizes the configuration to create a new AD forest, and promotes instances in two Availability Zones to Active Directory domain controllers.

To deploy this stack, follow the step-by-step instructions in the Deployment Steps section. After deploying this stack, you can move on to deploying your AD DS-dependent servers into the VPC. The DNS settings for new instances will be ready via the updated DHCP options set that is associated with the VPC. You'll also need to associate the new instances with the domain member security group that is created as part of this deployment.

=== Scenario 2: Extend your on-premises AD

Scenario 2 is for users who want to use their existing installation of AD DS and extend their on-premises network to the VPC. The on-premises Active Directory environment has one or more domain controllers, global catalog servers, or DNS servers. In this scenario, the newly created Windows Server instances are not automatically promoted to domain controllers. You need to perform postdeployment tasks.

image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/AD-architecture-scenario2.png[Architecture scenario 2]

As shown in <<architecture2>>, the AWS CloudFormation templates that automate this deployment set up the following (except for the virtual private network (VPN) gateway, VPN connection, and customer gateway, which you create manually):

* A VPC configured with public and private subnets in two Availability Zones for high availability.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed NAT gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** RD Gateway instances in an Auto Scaling group to help secure remote access to instances in private subnets.*
* In the private subnets, EC2 instances to act as domain controllers.

Scenario 2 provides an example of using a VPC and a virtual private gateway to enable communication with your own network over an IPsec VPN tunnel. Active Directory is deployed in the customer data center, and Windows servers are deployed into two VPC subnets. After deploying the VPN connection, you can promote the Windows instances to domain controllers in the on-premises Active Directory forest, making AD DS highly available in the AWS Cloud.

After you deploy the VPN connection and promote your servers to domain controllers, you can launch additional instances into the empty VPC subnets in the web, application, or database tier. These instances will have access to cloud-based domain controllers to help set up secure, low-latency directory services and DNS. All network traffic, including AD DS communication, authentication requests, and Active Directory replication, is secured either within the private subnets or across the VPN tunnel.

=== Scenario 3: Deploy AWS Managed Microsoft AD

Scenario 3 is similar to scenario 1, except that it includes AWS Directory Service to provision and manage AD DS on the AWS Cloud. Instead of fully managing AD DS yourself, you rely on AWS Directory Service for tasks such as building a highly available directory topology, monitoring domain controllers, and configuring backups and snapshots.

AWS Directory Service deploys AD DS across multiple Availability Zones, and automatically detects and replaces domain controllers that fail. AWS Directory Service also handles time-consuming tasks such as patch management, software updates, data replication, snapshot backups, replication monitoring, and point-in-time restores.

As shown in <<architecture3>>, the AWS CloudFormation templates that automate this deployment set up the following:

* A VPC configured with public and private subnets in two Availability Zones for high availability.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed NAT gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** RD Gateway instances in an Auto Scaling group to help secure remote access to instances in private subnets.*
* In the private subnets, an optional Windows EC2 instance to act as a management instance, including security groups and rules for traffic between instances.
* AWS Systems Manager Automation documents to set up and configure AD DS and AD-integrated DNS.
* AWS Secrets Manager to store passwords.
* AWS Directory Service to provision and manage AD DS in the private subnets.
